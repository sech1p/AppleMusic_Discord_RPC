# 🎶 Apple Music Discord Presence

*A simple tool that displays in Discord status the music you are currently listening to on Apple Music.*

## ⚠️ Notice 

This Discord Rich Presence was created back to 2022. Then, I learning Go programming language and this project is result of this learning. Few years later, my programming practices are much different than then. That's why commits style are mixed.

Apple some time ago released Apple Music application for Windows, it not scripted by me yet. Apple Music for Windows support will be introduced in v1.3.0.

Version v1.2.1 (released in end of April 2025, almost 2 years after last Presence update) introduces Presence executable for Apple Silicon.

This Presence is rarely updated, expect new releases every few months.

## ➕ Features

* You can show the world the music you taste without delay.
* Minimalistic.
* Fits in a few megabytes.
